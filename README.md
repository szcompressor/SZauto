## 3rd party libraries/tools
* Zstandard (https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). Zstandard v1.3.5 is included and will be used if libzstd can be found by pkg-config.
## Installation
* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[INSTALL_DIR]
* make
* make install 

Then, you'll find all the executables in [INSTALL_DIR]/bin and header files in [INSTALL_DIR]/include

## Testing Examples
You can use the executable 'sz_auto' command to do the compression/decompression.

* ./sz_auto testfloat_8_8_128.dat -3 8 8 128 1e-3

The order of the dimensions is the same as the c array. For example, use '-3 r1 r2 r3' for data[r1][r2][r3]
